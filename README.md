# computing_descriptive-statitics
This is a simple command-line application that allows users to perform basic **descriptive statistics** calculations on a given dataset. The application provides functionalities to calculate **measures of central tendency (mean, mode, median)** and measures of **dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation, mean deviation, quartile deviation)** for ungrouped data.

## Features

1. **Measure of Central Tendency:**

* Mean: The average value of the dataset.
* Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.
* Median: The middle value of the dataset when it is sorted.

2. **Measure of Dispersion:**

* Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.
* Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.
* Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance.
* Mean Deviation: The average of the absolute differences from the mean.
* Quartile Deviation: The difference between the first and third quartiles.

## Usage

* **Input Data Set:** Users are prompted to enter their dataset, consisting of numerical values separated by spaces.

* **Choose Operation:** Users can choose to calculate either a measure of central tendency or a measure of dispersion.
* **Calculate Statistics:** For measures of central tendency, users can choose between mean, mode, and median. For measures of dispersion, users can also choose between range, variance, standard deviation, mean deviation, and quartile deviation.
* **Display Results:** The application displays the calculated statistics based on the user's choice.

* **8Repeat or Exit:** Users can choose to perform additional calculations or exit the application.

## Installation
